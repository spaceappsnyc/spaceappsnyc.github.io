	<p><strong>This policy has been loosely adapted from the
	  StartupBus Code of Conduct written by Elias Bizannes and
	  Mitch Neff, which was in turn adopted from the Ada
	  Initiative's guide
	  titled <a href="http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/Conference_anti-harassment/Responding_to_reports"
	  target="_blank">"Conference anti-harassment/Responding to
	  Reports"</a>.</strong></p>

	<p><strong>About Space Apps NYC.</strong> Space Apps NYC is
	  the locally organized New York City site of
	  the <a href="http://2016.spaceappschallenge.org"
	  target="_blank">NASA Space Apps
	  Challenge</a>. We are not affiliated with NASA in any
	  official capacity, and all work performed by organizers here
	  is on a voluntary, not-for-profit basis. Please refer to the
	  Space Apps Challenge main web site
	  to <a href="https://2016.spaceappschallenge.org/legal"
	  target="_blank">read additional legal information</a>
	  regarding the event; statements made by the global Space
	  Apps organizers may supersede statements in this code of
	  conduct wherever applicable.</p>

	<p><strong>Participation at Space Apps NYC.</strong> You agree
	  that your presence at Space Apps NYC events indicates complete
	  compliance with all rules in this code of
	  conduct. Participants or non-participating observers
	  violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the
	  event and disallowed from participating in any future events
	  at the discretion of the organizers. Additionally you agree
	  that Space Apps NYC and participating sponsors and media
	  partners will be allowed to capture your sound and image via
	  any recording medium (audio, video, photo, any form of
	  artwork) at the event for use in promotion and marketing
	  with regard to their participation and your participation at
	  Space Apps NYC events.</p>

	<p><strong>Your Solutions at Space Apps NYC's Hackathon.</strong> The
	  purpose of the Space Apps Challenge is to incubate
	  grassroots innovation amongst participants of all
	  backgrounds in every corner of the globe. In the spirit of
	  international collaboration and for the betterment of all
	  humanity, all projects produced at the Space Apps NYC hackathon 
	  site are to be released into the public domain, per the charge of
	  the NASA Space Apps Challenge. There are no
	  so-called "intellectual property" considerations at this
	  event to be concerned with, because all work is to be made
	  free and open to everyone in the world. Please consider
	  attending another hackathon if you wish to make solutions
	  that are closed and proprietary.</p>

	<p><strong>Business Activity Restrictions at Space Apps
	  NYC's Hackathon.</strong> As such, Space Apps NYC asks that all
	  participants and non-participating observers refrain from
	  engaging in business related activity during the hackathon. This
	  hackathon is not a forum for business, it is an opportunity to
	  solve the world's problems and achieve social good for
	  all. Please respect that.</p>

	<p>These business related activities include, but are not
	  limited to: promotion of oneself or one's business, for
	  example - in-person networking unrelated to working on
	  Challenge projects, distributing printed materials or
	  branded merchandise of any kind, or making any kind of
	  unsanctioned announcements; pitching a business or idea that
	  is unrelated to the Challenges; any form of transactional or
	  sales activity, whether or not money is involved.</p>

	<p>If anyone engages in any business related activities in a
	  particularly inappropriate way, the organizers may take any
	  action they deem appropriate, including, but not limited to,
	  warning the offender or expulsion from the event and from
	  future events. The offender will be responsible at all times
	  for any of their own costs incurred. If you or your team are
	  experiencing any kind of disruption due to this type of
	  behavior, or if you have any other concerns, <em>please contact
	  a member of Space Apps NYC staff immediately</em>.</p>

	<p>Sponsors and partners are exempt from these conditions to
	  the degree that they are providing their open source and
	  unrestricted services to participants for use in their
	  projects or they have made a cash or in-kind consideration
	  to make our great events possible. Sponsors and partners are
	  subject to the limitations and exclusions in their
	  sponsorship agreements with Space Apps NYC. Please see the
	  <a href="https://2016.spaceappschallenge.org/legal"
	  target="_blank">NASA Space Apps Challenge legal
	  documentation</a> for more.</p>

	<p><strong>Safety and Harassment Protection at Space Apps
	  NYC.</strong>  Space Apps NYC is dedicated to providing a
	  harassment-free experience for everyone regardless of
	  gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation,
	  disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or
	  religion. We do not tolerate harassment of participants in
	  any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for
	  any event venue, including talks or pitches. Particularly so
	  at Space Apps NYC events as they are usually family events and 
	  regularly host underage children.</p>

	<p>Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to
	  gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation,
	  disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion,
	  sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation,
	  stalking, following, harassing photography or recording,
	  sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate
	  physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention. 
	  Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are 
	  expected to comply immediately and to not repeat their
	  behavior.</p>

	<p>Sponsors and partners are also subject to the
	  anti-harassment policy. In particular, sponsors and partners
	  should not use sexualized images in any activities or in any
	  other material. Representatives of our sponsors and partners
	  should not use sexualized clothing/uniforms/costumes, or
	  otherwise create a sexualized environment.</p>

	<p>Remember that exclusionary jokes can be offensive to those
	  around you and are not appropriate for Space Apps NYC.</p>

	<p>If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the
	  organizers may take any action they deem appropriate,
	  including warning the offender or expulsion from the
	  event. The participant will be responsible at all times for
	  any of their own costs incurred. If you are being harassed,
	  notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any
	  other concerns, <em>please contact a member of Space Apps NYC
	  staff immediately</em>.</p>

	<p><strong>Health, Care, and Liability at Space Apps NYC.</strong>
	  Any participant who is demonstrably unwell, behaving
	  erratically, or intoxicated will be asked to leave the event
	  immediately for the health and safety of all participants. 
	  Venue or event security, authorities, and/or medical 
	  professionals will be called to escort any unwell person 
	  from the site. Anyone so escorted will be entirely
	  responsible for any and all costs incurred, Space Apps NYC
	  assumes no liability or any other consequences from such
	  circumstances.</p>

	<p>No alcohol or other controlled or illegal substances of
	  any kind may be brought on site by participants at any time. 
	  Possession of such will result in immediate
	  expulsion, sanctioning, alerting authorities, and 
	  banning from future events.</p>
	  
	<p>Space Apps NYC intends to provide limited daycare 
	  services for certain participating attendees through 
	  a paid third party daycare service provider that is 
	  bonded and insured with certificates of insurance for 
	  the venue. Space Apps NYC assumes no responsibility 
	  or liability for children under the supervision of 
	  daycare providers, and is not responsible for any 
	  additional costs beyond the cost of on site care 
	  incurred by employing the third party daycare 
	  provider. Any and all children under the age of 18 
	  that are not in daycare must be accompanied by a 
	  parent or authorized guardian at all times. Any 
	  children discovered on site without parents or 
	  guardians present will be immediately remanded to 
	  authorities for their health and safety.
	</p>

	<p><strong>Please Contact Us Immediately Whenever You Need
	  Assistance.</strong> Space Apps NYC staff will be happy to
	  help participants contact venue security or local law
	  enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those
	  experiencing harassment to help them feel safe for the
	  duration of our events. We value your attendance.</p>

	<p>If the matter is especially urgent or a local
	  staff member is unavailable, please contact any of our
	  organizers &#8211; all reports are confidential.</p>
