        <h3><a id="welcome">Welcome Message</a></h3>

        <p>Welcome to the NASA Space Apps Challenge! We’ve noticed that many of you are new registrants this year, so we’re providing this guide to help you prepare for one of the most awesome space science and frontier technology events the city of New York has EVER seen.</p>

        <p><i>Space Apps NYC is no ordinary hackathon!</i> First and foremost, please read our <a href="conduct.html" target="_blank">Code of Conduct</a> to familiarize yourself with all of our policies - when you're at the hackathon registration table on site, we are going to ask you to sign a copy of it to acknowledge that you've read it, so look it over now.</p>

        <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;display: inline; font-style: italic; font-weight: bold">You must hack on a project for the majority of the weekend.</span> You should probably expect to spend around <span style="text-decoration: underline;display: inline;">a minimum of 11 full hours over the course of the weekend</span> working on a project. Everyone can contribute something, even if it's just working on the final presentation and demo!</p>

        <p>If you have hackathon participants who aren't contributing enough on your team, please notify a hackathon organizer and we will try to sort it all out. If we notice or hear reports that hackathon participants aren't contributing enough to their team, we may proceed with actions as laid out in the Code of Conduct</p>

        <p>Even though we are over-registered past our capacities, we still have dozens of people on our waitlists who want to participate in our Manhattan hackathon or boot camp, and we'd like to give everyone who's up for the challenge a chance to do something amazing for the common good; if you cannot come, please unregister for our hackathon and / or boot camp by selecting View Profile at the spaceappschallenge.org website and clicking the link marked "Remove My Registration". You may also be interested in registering to attend the <a href="https://2016.spaceappschallenge.org/locations/brooklyn-ny-usa" target="_blank">Brooklyn location</a>, which will have much more capacity for participants on site.</p>

        <p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>

        <h3><a id="arrival">Arrive Early For Entry;<br />ONLY 125 MAY ENTER - First Come, First Served</a></h3>

        <p>For the boot camp on <span style="font-weight: bold">Friday April 22nd</span>, <span style="text-decoration: underline;display: inline; font-style: italic;">You may want to arrive at the boot camp location before 8:00 a.m.</span> Yes, that is a very early time in the morning, but the early bird gets the space worm! Check your email for the boot camp location, if you're registered for boot camp you should have already received that information. If you are registered and have not received the location, please contact us via email immediately at organizers @ spaceapps.nyc.</p>

        <p>For the hackathon starting on <span style="font-weight: bold">Saturday April 23rd</span>, <span style="text-decoration: underline;display: inline; font-style: italic;">You may want to arrive at the hackathon location (<a href="http://lmhq.nyc" target="_blank">LMHQ</a>) before 8:00 a.m.</span> Yes, that is a very early time in the morning, but the early bird gets the space worm!</p>

        <p>We only have capacity for 125 people at the hackathon, even though more than double that number have registered to attend. We will be counting everyone as they enter, and when we reach capacity, anyone else in line will have to register as a Virtual Participant and hack from another location, or attend in Brooklyn - but anyone can still collaborate online with teams at our Manhattan site.</p>

        <p>If you would like to be guaranteed entry, we are looking for volunteers to help us at the hackathon - volunteers will need to commit to a certain number of hours / shifts in order to qualify for entry into the event. For more info, contact us immediately at organizers @ spaceapps.nyc!</p>

        <p>If you are coming from out of town for the event we <span style="font-weight: bold">HIGHLY recommend</span> arriving at the hackathon location as early as possible to best insure your entry into the hackathon. There are a limited number of hotel rooms* available at a discounted price at our partner hotel Residence Inn Marriott, located in the Financial District. You can get our group rate of <b>$219 USD per night</b> under the moniker "NASA Space Apps Challenge"</p>

        <p>Start date: 4/22/16<br />
        End date: 4/24/16<br />Last day to book: <span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold">4/18/16</span><br /></p>

        <h3><a id="childcare">Tell Us About Your Childcare Needs</a></h3>

        <p><span style="font-style: italic;">We really need your help!</span> We are committed to providing childcare for all three days of the boot camp and the hackathon, but you must tell us what your needs will be so that we can get enough service from the providers who will be caring for children on site. Please send us email at organizers at spaceapps.nyc to tell us what to expect!</p>

        <h3><a id="bootcamp">More On The Boot Camp Workshops</a></h3>

        <p>NASA is pioneering ways to diversify the base of hackathon participants to include communities with an ever-greater variety of backgrounds and skills and increase participation from underrepresented groups. On <b>Friday, April 22nd,</b> we are hosting another Space Apps Data Boot Camp - an opportunity for individuals (especially under-represented ones) who have never participated in hackathons to get their feet wet learning skills and using resources that will help them to engage productively as project team members, as well as to gain a better understanding of how their existing skills and perspectives can be an asset to their project teams.</p>

        <p>The boot camp is a free public event and space is very limited. For participants who have young children, childcare will also be provided for the boot camp at the very nearby LMHQ. If you already registered for the boot camp, you should have already received an email about it! Please check your inbox and spam filters to see if you got it.</p>

        <p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>

        <h3><a id="prepare">Make Some Pre-hackathon Preparations</a></h3>

        <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;display: inline; font-style: italic; font-weight: bold">VERY IMPORTANT VENUE CONSIDERATIONS:</span> If you are interested in hardware challenges, you should know that <span style="text-decoration: underline;display: inline; font-style: italic; font-weight: bold">NO SOLDERING OR HOT GLUING IS ALLOWED AT OUR VENUES</span>. If you bring your own equipment and electronic parts, you will only be able to do basic work and assemble parts into breadboards. You can bring pre-built, pre-soldered hardware to test and program, but our sites do not have available workshop or workbench facilities.</p>

        <p>If you are interested in hacking on your challenge throughout Saturday night, we will be able to stay overnight at the LMHQ venue!</p>

        <p>Should you bring a laptop? Absolutely, yes! Everyone should bring a computer with them that they feel comfortable using. Even if you don’t have any special software on it, bring it anyway; your team members and other mentors from top technology companies and educational institutions will be there to help you get set up with whatever you need, and teach you about some great tools to help you solve problems.</p>

        <p>Here are some other tasks we recommend you all do today, right now, regardless of your skills or background:</p>

        <p><span style="font-weight: bold">Join our Meetup group</span>- <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Space-Apps-NYC/" target="_blank">http://www.meetup.com/Space-Apps-NYC/</a></p>

        <p><span style="font-weight: bold">Sign up for a Github account (everybody needs one!)</span> - <a href="https://github.com/" target="_blank">https://github.com/</a></p>

        <p><span style="font-weight: bold">Try git</span> - <a href="https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1" target="_blank">https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1</a></p>

        <p>Once you're comfortable with git and Github, if you have an Apple laptop, you can "git clone" the scripts at the link below which will load up your computer with all the software you would need to do web development; even if you aren't a developer and don't want to become one, you'll be able to learn some really cool tips and tricks that will help you get more out of your computer, and doing this will generally make your computer more awesome:</p>

        <p>If you're already a developer (front end or back end) and have development software installed, <span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold">update all of your development software RIGHT NOW</span>. Save yourself a lot of wasted time and all the overhead of installing and updating a ton of stuff while you’re trying to hack.</p>

        <h3><a id="challenges">Check Out The 2016 Challenges Now</a></h3>

        <p>Take a look at this year's Challenges and see which you might be interested in working on:</p>

        <p><a href="https://2016.spaceappschallenge.org/challenges" target="_blank">https://2016.spaceappschallenge.org/challenges</a></p>

        <p>Don’t feel intimidated! You will be part of a great team with a diverse set of skills and you will all tackle these problems together. Notice that each Challenge has hashtags, where a # precedes a word or phrase (like #JourneyToMars or #BeAnAstronaut). When you write a tweet on Twitter or post a photo on Instagram and use one of those hashtags, other people all over the world will know you’re working on the same Challenge and you can collaborate and share ideas to make solutions together or independently. We also recommend the use of online video chat apps like Skype or Google Hangout to connect with people all over the world to get their help solving problems!</p>

        <p>Oh, and if you are an avid user of social media, please feel free to start using the following hashtags: #NewSpaceCity #SpaceApps #SpaceAppsNYC or mention us @SpaceAppsNYC or the global event at @SpaceApps or @NASA</p>
