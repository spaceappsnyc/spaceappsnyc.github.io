We recognize that today's potentially revolutionary scientific endeavors do not always lend themselves to traditional grant-based funding, and many promising technical innovations are not yet ripe for venture capital investment. Crowdfunding fills this funding gap and allows the public to participate in the scientific and entrepreneurial process."
