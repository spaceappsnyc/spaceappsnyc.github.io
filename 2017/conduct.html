  <h2>Code of Conduct</h2>
  <p><strong>This policy has been loosely adapted from the StartupBus Code of Conduct written by Elias Bizannes and Mitch Neff, which was in turn adopted from the Ada Initiative's guide titled <a href="http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/Conference_anti-harassment/Responding_to_reports" target="_blank">"Conference anti-harassment/Responding to Reports"</a>.</strong></p>
  <p><strong>About Space Apps NYC.</strong> Space Apps NYC is the locally organized New York City site of the <a href="http://2017.spaceappschallenge.org" target="_blank">NASA Space Apps Challenge</a>. We are not affiliated with NASA in any official capacity, and all work performed by organizers here is on a voluntary, not-for-profit basis. Please refer to the Space Apps Challenge main web site to <a href="https://2017.spaceappschallenge.org/legal" target="_blank">read additional legal information</a> regarding the event; statements made by the global Space Apps organizers may supersede statements in this code of conduct wherever applicable.</p>
  <p><strong>Participation at Space Apps NYC.</strong> You agree that your presence at Space Apps NYC events indicates complete compliance with all rules in this code of conduct. Participants or non-participating observers violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the event and disallowed from participating in any future events at the discretion of the organizers. Additionally you agree that Space Apps NYC and participating sponsors and media partners will be allowed to capture your sound and image via any recording medium (audio, video, photo, any form of artwork) at the event for use in promotion and marketing with regard to their participation and your participation at Space Apps NYC events.</p>
  <p><strong>Your Solutions at Space Apps NYC's Hackathon.</strong> The purpose of the Space Apps Challenge is to incubate grassroots innovation amongst participants of all backgrounds in every corner of the globe. In the spirit of international collaboration and for the betterment of all humanity, all projects produced at the Space Apps NYC hackathon  site are to be released into the public domain, per the charge of the NASA Space Apps Challenge. There are no so-called "intellectual property" considerations at this event to be concerned with, because all work is to be made free and open to everyone in the world. Please consider attending another hackathon if you wish to make solutions that are closed and proprietary.</p>
  <p><strong>Business Activity Restrictions at Space Apps NYC's Hackathon.</strong> As such, Space Apps NYC asks that all participants and non-participating observers refrain from engaging in business related activity during the hackathon. This hackathon is not a forum for business, it is an opportunity to solve the world's problems and achieve social good for all. Please respect that.</p>
  <p>These business related activities include, but are not limited to: promotion of oneself or one's business, for example - in-person networking unrelated to working on Challenge projects, distributing printed materials or branded merchandise of any kind, or making any kind of unsanctioned announcements; pitching a business or idea that is unrelated to the Challenges; any form of transactional or sales activity, whether or not money is involved.</p>
  <p>If anyone engages in any business related activities in a particularly inappropriate way, the organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, including, but not limited to, warning the offender or expulsion from the event and from future events. The offender will be responsible at all times for any of their own costs incurred. If you or your team are experiencing any kind of disruption due to this type of behavior, or if you have any other concerns, <em>please contact a member of Space Apps NYC staff immediately</em>.</p>
  <p>Sponsors and partners are exempt from these conditions to the degree that they are providing their open source and unrestricted services to participants for use in their projects or they have made a cash or in-kind consideration to make our great events possible. Sponsors and partners are subject to the limitations and exclusions in their sponsorship agreements with Space Apps NYC. Please see the <a href="https://2017.spaceappschallenge.org/legal" target="_blank">NASA Space Apps Challenge legal documentation</a> for more.</p>
  <p><strong>Safety and Harassment Protection at Space Apps NYC.</strong>  Space Apps NYC is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any event venue, including talks or pitches. Particularly so at Space Apps NYC events as they are usually family events and  regularly host underage children.</p>
  <p>Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.  Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are  expected to comply immediately and to not repeat their behavior.</p>
  <p>Sponsors and partners are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular, sponsors and partners should not use sexualized images in any activities or in any other material. Representatives of our sponsors and partners should not use sexualized clothing/uniforms/costumes, or otherwise create a sexualized environment.</p>
  <p>Remember that exclusionary jokes can be offensive to those around you and are not appropriate for Space Apps NYC.</p>
  <p>If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the event. The participant will be responsible at all times for any of their own costs incurred. If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, <em>please contact a member of Space Apps NYC staff immediately</em>.</p>
  <p><strong>Health, Care, and Liability at Space Apps NYC.</strong> Any participant who is demonstrably unwell, behaving erratically, or intoxicated will be asked to leave the event immediately for the health and safety of all participants.  Venue or event security, authorities, and/or medical  professionals will be called to escort any unwell person  from the site. Anyone so escorted will be entirely responsible for any and all costs incurred, Space Apps NYC assumes no liability or any other consequences from such circumstances.</p>
  <p>No alcohol or other controlled or illegal substances of any kind may be brought on site by participants at any time.  Possession of such will result in immediate expulsion, sanctioning, alerting authorities, and  banning from future events.</p>
  <p>Space Apps NYC intends to provide limited daycare  services for certain participating attendees through  a paid third party daycare service provider that is  bonded and insured with certificates of insurance for  the venue. Space Apps NYC assumes no responsibility  or liability for children under the supervision of  daycare providers, and is not responsible for any  additional costs beyond the cost of on site care  incurred by employing the third party daycare  provider. Any and all children under the age of 18  that are not in daycare must be accompanied by a  parent or authorized guardian at all times. Any  children discovered on site without parents or  guardians present will be immediately remanded to  authorities for their health and safety.</p>
  <p><strong>Please Contact Us Immediately Whenever You Need Assistance.</strong> Space Apps NYC staff will be happy to help participants contact venue security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to help them feel safe for the duration of our events. We value your attendance.</p>
  <p>If the matter is especially urgent or a local staff member is unavailable, please contact any of our organizers &#8211; all reports are confidential.</p>
