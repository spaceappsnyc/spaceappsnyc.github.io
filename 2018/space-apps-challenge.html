    <h1>WHAT IS THE SPACE APPS CHALLENGE?</h1>
    <p>The NASA Space Apps Challenge is a worldwide NASA Incubator Innovation program. Grassroots organizers from all
        across the planet stage a weekend-long hackathon at their local site where teams of technologists, scientists,
        designers, artists, educators, entrepreneurs, developers, students, and anyone else interested in space
        exploration can collaborate with their fellow global citizens and utilize publicly available data to design
        innovative solutions for challenges posed by NASA, other governmental agencies, NGOs, and a variety of
        institutions.</p>
    <p>Basically you get to work directly with NASA to save the world. Pretty cool, huh?</p>
    <p>Space Apps NYC is New York City's Space Apps Challenge site, and is locally organized by its 2800+ member community.</p>

      <h2>Welcome Message</h2>

      <p>Welcome to the NASA Space Apps Challenge! We've noticed that many of you are new registrants this year, so
        we're providing this guide to help you prepare for one of the most awesome space science and frontier
        technology events the city of New York has EVER seen.</p>

      <p><em>Space Apps NYC is no ordinary hackathon!</em> First and foremost, please read our <a href="http://bit.ly/SANCodeOfConduct"
          target="_blank">Code of Conduct</a> to familiarize yourself with all of our policies - when you're at the
        hackathon registration table on site, we are going to ask you to sign a copy of it to acknowledge that you've
        read it, so look it over now.</p>

      <p><strong><em style="text-decoration: underline;">You must hack
            on a project for the majority of the weekend.</em></strong> You should probably expect to spend around
        <span style="text-decoration: underline;">a
          minimum of 11 full hours over the course of the weekend</span> working on a project. Everyone can contribute
        something, even if it's just working on the final presentation and demo!</p>

      <p>If you have hackathon participants who aren't contributing enough on your team, please notify a hackathon
        organizer and we will try to sort it all out. If we notice or hear reports that hackathon participants aren't
        contributing enough to their team, we may proceed with actions as laid out in the Code of Conduct</p>

      <p>Even though we are over-registered past our capacities, we still have dozens of people on our waitlists who
        want to participate in our Manhattan hackathon or bootcamp, and we'd like to give everyone who's up for the
        challenge a chance to do something amazing for the common good; if you cannot come, please unregister for our
        hackathon and/or bootcamp by selecting View Profile at the spaceappschallenge.org website and clicking the
        link marked "Remove My Registration". If you cannot attend the event on-site, or arrived after capacity was
        met, you can still participate on a New York team remotely. Alternatively, you can <a href="https://2018.spaceappschallenge.org/locations/virtual/">join
          a virtual team</a>.</p>

    <section class="card" id="arrival">
      <h2>Arrive Early For Entry</h2>
      <h3>ONLY 100 MAY ENTER - First Come, First Served</h3>

      <!-- <p>For the boot camp on <span style="font-weight: bold">Friday April 22nd</span>, <span style="text-decoration: underline;display: inline; font-style: italic;">You
          may want to arrive at the boot camp location before 8:00 a.m.</span> Yes, that is a very early time in the
        morning, but the early bird gets the space worm! Check your email for the boot camp location, if you're
        registered for boot camp you should have already received that information. If you are registered and have not
        received the location, please contact us via email immediately at organizers @ spaceapps.nyc.</p> -->

      <p>For the hackathon starting on <strong>Saturday October 20th</strong>, <em style="text-decoration: underline;">You
          may want to arrive at the hackathon location (<a href="https://girlsclub.org" target="_blank">Lower Eastside
            Girls Club</a>) before 8:00 a.m.</em> Yes, that is a very early time in the morning, but the early bird
        gets the space worm!</p>

      <p>We only have capacity for 100 people at the hackathon, even though more than double that number have
        registered to attend. We will be counting everyone as they enter, and when we reach capacity, anyone else in
        line will have to register as a Virtual Participant and hack from another location - but
        anyone can still collaborate online with teams at our Manhattan site.</p>

      <p>If you would like to be guaranteed entry, we are looking for volunteers to help us at the hackathon -
        volunteers will need to commit to a certain number of hours / shifts in order to qualify for entry into the
        event. For more info, contact us immediately at organizers @ spaceapps.nyc!</p>

      <p>If you are coming from out of town for the event we <strong>HIGHLY recommend</strong>
        arriving at the hackathon location as early as possible to best insure your entry into the hackathon. For those
        of you travelling from out of town, we would even recommend getting a hotel room the night before in order to
        make sure you arrive on time.</p>

      <h2>Tell Us About Your Childcare Needs</h2>

      <p><span style="font-style: italic;">We really need your help!</span> We are committed to providing childcare for
        all three days of the boot camp and the hackathon, but you must tell us what your needs will be so that we can
        get enough service from the providers who will be caring for children on site. Please send us email at
        organizers at spaceapps.nyc to tell us what to expect!</p>

      <h2>More On The Bootcamp Workshops</h2>

      <p>NASA is pioneering ways to diversify the base of hackathon participants to include communities with an
        ever-greater variety of backgrounds and skills and increase participation from underrepresented groups. For two
        weeks starting on <strong>Tuesday, October 9th</strong> and ending on <strong>Wednesday, October 17th</strong>,
        we are hosting our Space Apps Data Bootcamp - an opportunity for individuals (especially
        under-represented ones) who have never participated in hackathons to get their feet wet learning skills and
        using resources that will help them to engage productively as project team members, as well as to gain a better
        understanding of how their existing skills and perspectives can be an asset to their project teams.</p>

      <p>The boot camp is a free public event and space is very limited. If you already registered for the
        boot camp, you should have already received an email about it! Please check your inbox and spam filters to see
        if you got it.</p>

      <p><a class="button" href="bootcamp">Check out this year's Data Bootcamps!</a></p>

      <h2>Make Some Pre-hackathon Preparations</h2>

      <p><strong><em style="text-decoration: underline;">VERY IMPORTANT VENUE CONSIDERATIONS:</em></strong> If you are
        interested in hardware challenges, you should know that <strong><em style="text-decoration: underline;">NO
            SOLDERING OR HOT GLUING IS ALLOWED AT OUR VENUES</em></strong>. If you bring your own equipment and
        electronic
        parts, you will only be able to do basic work and assemble parts into breadboards. You can bring pre-built,
        pre-soldered hardware to test and program, but our sites do not have available workshop or workbench
        facilities.</p>

      <p>If you are interested in hacking on your challenge throughout Saturday night, we will be able to stay
        overnight at the Lower Eastside Girls Club venue!</p>

      <p>Should you bring a laptop? Absolutely, yes! Everyone should bring a computer with them that they feel
        comfortable using. Even if you don't have any special software on it, bring it anyway; your team members and
        other mentors from top technology companies and educational institutions will be there to help you get set up
        with whatever you need, and teach you about some great tools to help you solve problems.</p>

      <p>Here are some other tasks we recommend you all do today, right now, regardless of your skills or background:</p>

      <p><strong>Join our Meetup group</strong>- <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Space-Apps-NYC/" target="_blank">http://www.meetup.com/Space-Apps-NYC/</a></p>

      <p><strong>Follow @SpaceAppsNYC on Twitter</strong> - <a href="https://twitter.com/" target="_blank">https://twitter.com/</a></p>

      <p><strong>Sign up for a Github account (everybody needs one!)</strong> - <a href="https://github.com/" target="_blank">https://github.com/</a></p>

      <p><strong>Try git</strong> - <a href="https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1" target="_blank">https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1</a></p>

      <p><a href="http://readwrite.com/2013/09/30/understanding-github-a-journey-for-beginners-part-1" target="_blank">http://readwrite.com/2013/09/30/understanding-github-a-journey-for-beginners-part-1</a></p>

      <p>Once you're comfortable with git and Github, if you have an Apple laptop, you can "git clone" the scripts at
        the link below which will load up your computer with all the software you would need to do web development;
        even if you aren't a developer and don't want to become one, you'll be able to learn some really cool tips and
        tricks that will help you get more out of your computer, and doing this will generally make your computer more
        awesome: <strong><a href="https://github.com/18F/laptop" target="_blank">https://github.com/18F/laptop</a></strong></p>

      <p>If you're already a developer (front end or back end) and have development software installed, <strong><em>update
            all of your development software RIGHT NOW</em></strong>. Save yourself a lot of wasted time and all the
        overheadof installing and updating a ton of stuff while you're trying to hack.</p>

      <h2>Check Out The 2018 Challenges Now</h2>

      <p>Take a look at this year's Challenges and see which you might be interested in working on: <a href="https://2018.spaceappschallenge.org/challenges"
          target="_blank">https://2018.spaceappschallenge.org/challenges</a></p>

      <p>Don't feel intimidated! You will be part of a great team with a diverse set of skills and you will all tackle
        these problems together. Notice that each Challenge has hashtags, where a # precedes a word or phrase (like
        #JourneyToMars or #BeAnAstronaut). When you write a tweet on Twitter or post a photo on Instagram and use one
        of those hashtags, other people all over the world will know you're working on the same Challenge and you can
        collaborate and share ideas to make solutions together or independently. We also recommend the use of online
        video chat apps like Skype or Google Hangout to connect with people all over the world to get their help
        solving problems!</p>

      <p>Oh, and if you are an avid user of social media, please feel free to start using the following hashtags:
        #NewSpaceCity #SpaceApps #SpaceAppsNYC or mention us @SpaceAppsNYC or the global event at @SpaceApps or @NASA</p>
