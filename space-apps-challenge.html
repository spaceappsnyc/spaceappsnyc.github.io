      <h2>Welcome Message</h2>

      <p>Welcome to the NASA Space Apps Challenge! We've noticed that many of you are new registrants this year, so
        we're providing this guide to help you prepare for one of the most awesome space science and frontier technology
        events the city of New York has EVER seen.</p>

      <p><em>Space Apps NYC is no ordinary hackathon!</em> First and foremost, please read our <a
          href="http://bit.ly/SANCodeOfConduct" target="_blank">Code of Conduct</a> to familiarize yourself with all of
        our policies - by participating in the hackathon you implicitly acknowledge that you've read it, so look it over
        now.</p>

      <p><strong><em style="text-decoration: underline;">You must hack on a project for the majority of the
            weekend.</em></strong> You should probably expect to spend around <span
          style="text-decoration: underline;">a minimum of 11 full hours over the course of the weekend</span> working
        on a project. Everyone can contribute something, even if it's just working on the final presentation and demo!
      </p>

      <p>If you have hackathon participants who aren't contributing enough on your team, please notify a hackathon
        organizer and we will try to sort it all out. If we notice or hear reports that hackathon participants aren't
        contributing enough to their team, we may proceed with actions as laid out in the Code of Conduct.</p>

      <p>Even though we are over-registered past our capacities, we still have dozens of people on our waitlists who
        want to participate in our hackathon or bootcamp, and we'd like to give everyone who's up for the
        challenge a chance to do something amazing for the common good; if you cannot come, please unregister for our
        hackathon and/or bootcamp by selecting View Profile at the spaceappschallenge.org website and clicking the
        link marked "Remove My Registration". If you cannot attend the event on-site, or arrived after capacity was
        met, you can still participate on a New York team remotely. Alternatively, you can <a
          href="https://{{ site.year }}.spaceappschallenge.org/locations/virtual/">join
          a virtual team</a>.</p>

    <section id="arrival">
      <h2>Arrive Early For Entry</h2>
      <h3>SPACE IS LIMITED - First Come, First Served</h3>

      <!-- <p>For the boot camp on <span style="font-weight: bold">Friday April 22nd</span>, <span style="text-decoration: underline;display: inline; font-style: italic;">You
          may want to arrive at the boot camp location before 8:00 a.m.</span> Yes, that is a very early time in the
        morning, but the early bird gets the space worm! Check your email for the boot camp location, if you're
        registered for boot camp you should have already received that information. If you are registered and have not
        received the location, please contact us via email immediately at organizers @ spaceapps.nyc.</p> -->

      <p>For the hackathon starting on <strong>Saturday October 19th</strong>, <em
          style="text-decoration: underline;">You may want to arrive at the hackathon location before 9:00 a.m.</em>
        Yes, that is a very early time in the morning, but the early bird gets the space worm!</p>

      <p>We only have capacity for 60 people at each hackathon location, even though more than double that number have
        registered to attend. We will be counting everyone as they enter, and when we reach capacity, anyone else in
        line will have to collaborate online with teams at our Manhattan and Brooklyn sites, or register as a Virtual
        Participant and hack from another location.</p>

      <p>If you would like to be guaranteed entry, we are looking for volunteers to help us at the hackathon -
        volunteers will need to commit to a certain number of hours / shifts in order to qualify for entry into the
        event. For more info, contact us immediately at organizers @ spaceapps.nyc!</p>

      <p>If you are coming from out of town for the event we <strong>HIGHLY recommend</strong>
        arriving at the hackathon location as early as possible to best insure your entry into the hackathon. For those
        of you travelling from out of town, we would even recommend getting a hotel room the night before in order to
        make sure you arrive on time.</p>

    <!-- <section id="childcare">
      <h2>Tell Us About Your Childcare Needs</h2>

      <p><span style="font-style: italic;">We really need your help!</span> We are committed to providing childcare for
        all three days of the boot camp and the hackathon, but you must tell us what your needs will be so that we can
        get enough service from the providers who will be caring for children on site. Please send us email at
        organizers at spaceapps.nyc to tell us what to expect!</p>

    <section id="bootcamp">
      <h2>More On The Bootcamp Workshops</h2>

      <p>NASA is pioneering ways to diversify the base of hackathon participants to include communities with an
        ever-greater variety of backgrounds and skills and increase participation from underrepresented groups. For the
        week leading up to the hackathon, we are hosting our Space Apps Data Bootcamp - an opportunity for individuals
        (especially under-represented ones in tech) who have never participated in hackathons to get their feet wet
        learning skills and using resources that will help them to engage productively as project team members, as well
        as to gain a better understanding of how their existing skills and perspectives can be an asset to their project
        teams.</p>

      <p>The boot camp is a free public event and space is very limited. If you already registered for the
        boot camp, you should have already received an email about it! Please check your inbox and spam filters to see
        if you got it.</p>

      <h2>Make Some Pre-hackathon Preparations</h2>

      <p><strong><em style="text-decoration: underline;">VERY IMPORTANT VENUE CONSIDERATIONS:</em></strong> If you are
        interested in hardware challenges, you should know that <strong><em style="text-decoration: underline;">NO
            SOLDERING OR HOT GLUING IS ALLOWED AT OUR VENUES</em></strong>. If you bring your own equipment and
        electronic parts, you will only be able to do basic work and assemble parts into breadboards. You can bring
        pre-built, pre-soldered hardware to test and program, but our sites do not have available workshop or workbench
        facilities.</p>

      <p>If you are interested in hacking on your challenge throughout Saturday night, overnight hacking is only
        available at the Brooklyn location. Manhattan participants will have the option to head to Brooklyn after the
        Manhattan venue closes, then come back to Manhattan for Sunday demos.</p>

      <p>Should you bring a laptop? Absolutely, yes! Everyone should bring a computer with them that they feel
        comfortable using. Even if you don't have any special software on it, bring it anyway; your team members and
        other mentors from top technology companies and educational institutions will be there to help you get set up
        with whatever you need, and teach you about some great tools to help you solve problems.</p>

      <p>Here are some other tasks we recommend you all do today, right now, regardless of your skills or background:
      </p>

      <p><strong>Join our Meetup group</strong>- <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Space-Apps-NYC/"
          target="_blank">http://www.meetup.com/Space-Apps-NYC/</a></p>

      <p><strong>Follow @SpaceAppsNYC on Twitter</strong> - <a href="https://twitter.com/"
          target="_blank">https://twitter.com/</a></p>

      <p><strong>Sign up for a Github account (everybody needs one!)</strong> - <a href="https://github.com/"
          target="_blank">https://github.com/</a></p>

      <p><strong>Try git</strong> - <a href="https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1"
          target="_blank">https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1</a></p>

      <p><a href="http://readwrite.com/2013/09/30/understanding-github-a-journey-for-beginners-part-1"
          target="_blank">http://readwrite.com/2013/09/30/understanding-github-a-journey-for-beginners-part-1</a></p>

      <p>Once you're comfortable with git and Github, if you have an Apple laptop, you can "git clone" the scripts at
        the link below which will load up your computer with all the software you would need to do web development;
        even if you aren't a developer and don't want to become one, you'll be able to learn some really cool tips and
        tricks that will help you get more out of your computer, and doing this will generally make your computer more
        awesome: <strong><a href="https://github.com/18F/laptop"
            target="_blank">https://github.com/18F/laptop</a></strong></p>

      <p>If you're already a developer (front end or back end) and have development software installed,
        <strong><em>update all of your development software RIGHT NOW</em></strong>. Save yourself a lot of wasted time
        and all the overheadof installing and updating a ton of stuff while you're trying to hack.</p>

      <h2>Check Out The {{ site.year }} Challenges Now</h2>
      <h3>{{ site.year }} Challenges may not be available until October {{ site.year }}</h3>
      <p>Take a look at this year's Challenges and see which you might be interested in working on: <a
          href="https://{{ site.year }}.spaceappschallenge.org/challenges"
          target="_blank">https://{{ site.year }}.spaceappschallenge.org/challenges</a></p>

      <p>Don't feel intimidated! You will be part of a great team with a diverse set of skills and you will all tackle
        these problems together. Notice that each Challenge has hashtags, where a # precedes a word or phrase (like
        #JourneyToMars or #BeAnAstronaut). When you write a tweet on Twitter or post a photo on Instagram and use one
        of those hashtags, other people all over the world will know you're working on the same Challenge and you can
        collaborate and share ideas to make solutions together or independently. We also recommend the use of online
        video chat apps like Skype or Google Hangout to connect with people all over the world to get their help
        solving problems!</p>

      <p>Oh, and if you are an avid user of social media, please feel free to start using the following hashtags:
        #NewSpaceCity #SpaceApps #SpaceAppsNYC or mention us @SpaceAppsNYC or the global event at @SpaceApps or @NASA
