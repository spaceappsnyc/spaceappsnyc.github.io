	<p><strong>This policy has been loosely adapted from the
	  StartupBus Code of Conduct written by Elias Bizannes and
	  Mitch Neff, which was in turn adopted from the Ada
	  Initiative's guide
	  titled <a href="http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/Conference_anti-harassment/Responding_to_reports"
	  target="_blank">"Conference anti-harassment/Responding to
	  Reports"</a>.</strong></p>

	<p>Space Apps NYC is the locally organized New York City site
	  of the NASA International Space Apps Challenge. We are not
	  affiliated with NASA in any official capacity, and all work
	  performed by organizers here is on a voluntary,
	  not-for-profit basis. Please refer to the Space Apps
	  Challenge main web site to read additional legal information
	  regarding the event; statements made by the global Space
	  Apps organizers may supersede statements in this code of
	  conduct wherever applicable.</p>

	<p>You agree that your presence at the event indicates
	  complete compliance with all rules in this code of
	  conduct. Participants or non-participating observers
	  violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the
	  event and disallowed from participating in any future events
	  at the discretion of the organizers.</p>

	<p>The purpose of the Space Apps Challenge is to incubate
	  grassroots innovation amongst participants of all
	  backgrounds in every corner of the globe. In the spirit of
	  international collaboration and for the betterment of all
	  humanity, all projects produced at the Space Apps NYC site
	  are to be released into the public domain, per the charge of
	  the International Space Apps Challenge. There are no
	  so-called "intellectual property" considerations at this
	  event to be concerned with, because all work is to be made
	  free and open to everyone in the world. Please consider 
	  attending another event if you wish to make commercially
	  viable solutions.</p>

	<p>As such, Space Apps NYC asks that all participants and
	  non-participating observers refrain from engaging in
	  business related activity during the event. This event is
	  not a forum for business, it is an opportunity to solve the
	  world's problems and achieve social good for all. Please
	  respect that.</p>

	<p>These business related activities include, but are not
	  limited to: promotion of oneself or one's business, for
	  example - in-person networking unrelated to working on
	  Challenge projects, distributing printed materials or
	  branded merchandise of any kind, or making any kind of
	  unsanctioned announcements; pitching a business or idea that
	  is unrelated to the Challenges; any form of transactional or
	  sales activity, whether or not money is involved.</p>

	<p>If anyone engages in any business related activities in a
	  particularly inappropriate way, the organizers may take any
	  action they deem appropriate, including, but not limited to,
	  warning the offender or expulsion from the event and from
	  future events. The offender will be responsible at all times
	  for any of their own costs incurred. If you or your team are
	  experiencing any kind of disruption due to this type of
	  behavior, or if you have any other concerns, please contact
	  a member of Space Apps NYC staff immediately.</p>

	<p>Sponsors and partners are exempt from these conditions to
	  the degree that they are providing their open source and
	  unrestricted services to participants for use in their
	  projects or have made a cash or in-kind consideration to
	  make our great event possible. Sponsors and partners are
	  subject to the limitations and exclusions in their
	  sponsorship agreement with Space Apps NYC. Please see the
	  International Space Apps Challenge legal documentation for
	  more.</p>

	<p>Space Apps NYC is dedicated to providing a harassment-free
	  experience for everyone regardless of gender, gender
	  identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability,
	  physical appearance, body size, race, or religion. We do not
	  tolerate harassment of participants in any form. Sexual
	  language and imagery is not appropriate for any event venue,
	  including talks or pitches. Particularly so at Space Apps
	  NYC which is a family event and regularly hosts underage
	  children.</p>

	<p>Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to
	  gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation,
	  disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion,
	  sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation,
	  stalking, following, harassing photography or recording,
	  sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate
	  physical contact, and unwelcome sexual
	  attention. Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior
	  are expected to comply immediately.</p>

	<p>Sponsors and partners are also subject to the
	  anti-harassment policy. In particular, sponsors and partners
	  should not use sexualized images in activities or in any
	  other material. Representatives of our sponsors and partners
	  should not use sexualized clothing/uniforms/costumes, or
	  otherwise create a sexualized environment.</p>

	<p>Remember that exclusionary jokes can be offensive to those
	  around you and are not appropriate for Space Apps NYC.</p>

	<p>If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the
	  organizers may take any action they deem appropriate,
	  including warning the offender or expulsion from the
	  event. The participant will be responsible at all times for
	  any of their own costs incurred. If you are being harassed,
	  notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any
	  other concerns, please contact a member of Space Apps NYC
	  staff immediately.</p>

	<p>Any participant who is demonstrably unwell, behaving
	  erratically, or intoxicated will be asked to leave the event
	  immediately for the health and safety of all
	  participants. Venue or event security, authorities, and/or
	  medical professionals will be called to escort any unwell
	  person from the site. Anyone so escorted will be entirely
	  responsible for any and all costs incurred, Space Apps NYC
	  assumes no liability or any other consequences from such
	  circumstances.</p>

	<p>No alchohol or other controlled or illegal substances of
	  any kind will be allowed on site at any time (excluding
	  alcohol served at other event related venues where the venue
	  is responsible for the sale and service of food and
	  beverages). Possession of such will result in immediate
	  expulsion, sanctioning, and banning from future events.</p>

	<p>Space Apps NYC staff will be happy to help participants
	  contact venue security or local law enforcement, provide
	  escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment
	  to help them feel safe for the duration of the event. We
	  value your attendance.</p>

	<p>If the matter is especially urgent or a local
	  staff member is unavailable, please contact any of our
	  organizers &#8211; all reports are confidential.</p>
