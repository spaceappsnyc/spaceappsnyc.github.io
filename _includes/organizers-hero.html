    <h1>THE TEAM BEHIND <strong>SPACE APPS NYC</strong></h1>
    <p><strong>Organizers</strong> are ultimately responsible for the hackathon success. They recruit sponsors, secure
        venues, manage marketing campaigns, schedule speakers, and run the event. All of our organizers are volunteers
        from the Space Apps community.</p>
    <p><strong>Organizing Partners</strong> are other organizations who assist in organizing the event.</p>
    <p><strong>Sponsors</strong> make financial contributions in exchange for recruiting opportunities and a precense
        at the event.</p>
    <p><strong>Partners</strong> help market the event and make a variety of non-financial contributions.</p>
