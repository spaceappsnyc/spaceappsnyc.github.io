    <h1>WHAT IS THE SPACE APPS CHALLENGE?</h1>
    <p>The <a href="http://2017.spaceappschallenge.org/" target="_blank">NASA Space Apps Challenge</a> is a worldwide <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/" target="_blank">NASA</a> Incubator Innovation program. Grassroots organizers from all across the planet stage a weekend-long hackathon at their local site where teams of technologists, scientists, designers, artists, educators, entrepreneurs, developers, students, and anyone else interested in space exploration can collaborate with their fellow global citizens and utilize publicly available data to design innovative solutions for challenges posed by NASA, other governmental agencies, NGOs, and a variety of institutions.</p>
    <p>Basically you get to work directly with NASA to save the world. Pretty cool, huh?</p>
    <p>Space Apps NYC is New York City's Space Apps Challenge site, and is locally organized by its 2000+ member community.</p>
